Steps for Sentimental Analysis: 
1) Tokenizing sentences to break text down into words, or other units.
2) Removing stop words like “if,” “but,” “or,” and so on.
3) Normalizing words by condensing all forms of a word into a single form.
4) Vectorizing text by turning the text into a numerical representation for consumption by your classifier.

2) glob
